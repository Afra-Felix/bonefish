# Contributing to Bonefish

If you would like to contribute to the project we welcome your patches. You can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request. For simple patches, feel free to submit pull requests and we will review them in a timely manner. For larger patches that modify a significant amount of code, we want to make sure that the design and architectural aspects of your code match up with our own vision for Bonefish. Please open an issue to discuss the work you are intending to do, so we can avoid disappointment from rejecting patches or requiring any significant rework.

We also ask that you submit your patches following the existing conventions and style used in the project. Patches that do not adhere to the project`s conventions and style will not be accepted until those criteria are met.
