- split component and router roles into two different types
- create a proper bonefish daemon process
- manage proper startup and shutdown of daemon process
- add approriate system/debug logging facilities
- add appropriate json based daemon configuration
- add proper uri validation according to the spec
- move uri checking out of the serialiation and allow each broker/dealer/router to perform uri validation so that the appropriate error messages can be generated where applicable.
- add support for publish options so that publish acknowledgements can be used. make sure you read the event specs carefully as you should not acknowledge the publisher if it is also a subscriber or some such nonsense
