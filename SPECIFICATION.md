WAMP Specification
==================

Bonefish is based on a set of open-source specifications for WAMP application servers. The specification is split into two parts:

- [**Basic**](https://github.com/tavendo/WAMP/blob/master/spec/basic.md)
- [**Advanced**](https://github.com/tavendo/WAMP/blob/master/spec/advanced.md)

## Basic

The basic specification contains all of the architectural overview, fundamental building blocks, and definitions necessary to build a minimally complete WAMP application server. It acts as a software design reference for bonefish. If you want to get an understanding of the basic operation of a WAMP application server this is a good starting point.

## Advanced

The advanced specification is basically a document that details the extentions and features that can be built on top of the basic profile.
